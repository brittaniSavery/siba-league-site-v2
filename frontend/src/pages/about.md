## The SIBA

The Simulation Internet Basketball Association (SIBA for short) and
its related leagues (the developmental and college leagues) was the
combined efforts of Kelley and Brittani Avery, a father and daughter team.
Sharing a love of basketball and statistics, they worked together to
create the league as a way to spend quality time together. Kelley created
the teams, logos, and rules of the league while Brittani provided her
technical expertise to build the website and other important tools to
support it.

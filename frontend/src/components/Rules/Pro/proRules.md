- Trades
- Contract signings Outside of Off-Season Free Agency

For these and other Commissioner-only requests, please put them in the appropriate channels in Discord.

## In-Season Free Agent Signing

In-Season Free Agent Signing is started by a team posting the player they wish to sign in the `#siba-transactions` channel in Discord. Then that player is available until the next sim or for 6 hours, whichever period is shorter, to give any other teams a chance of signing him. After the waiting period, Commissioner will use the website [True Random Number Generator](http://www.random.org/) to calculate the number. Three random numbers will be average together to get the free agent number of interest.

The following are the changes to sign the free agent depending on the number of interested teams.

1. If only one team is involved, then that team signs him.
2. If two teams are involved, then the first team has a 85% chance of signing him and the second team has only 15%. Example: team one has from (1-85) and team two has from (86-100).
3. If three teams are involved, then the break down is team one gets 80% (1-80), team two get 15% (81-95), and team three get 5% (96-100).
4. If four teams are involved, then the break down is team one gets 75% (1-75), team two gets 15% (76-90), team three gets 7% (91-97), and team four gets 3% (98-100).

**NOTE:** Only four teams can claim a free agent. After the fourth team has
claimed him, the claims are finalized. Only the first four teams will
have the chance of signing the player.

## SIBA Luxury Tax Penalties

Teams that are over the Luxury Tax for 2 consecutive seasons will face penalties.

### Lost of Draft Picks

Teams that are over the Salary Cap by $29 million will have to forfeit their highest second round pick in next draft.

Teams that are over the Salary Cap by $54 million will have to forfeit their highest first round pick in next draft.

### Lost of Reward Points

If teams that are over the Luxury Tax Cap for 2 consecutive seasons by $25 million and do not have draft picks will forfeit Reward points for the 2nd season.

These Reward Points will go to the teams with the worst record in order of highest **points**. The highest amount of points would go to the worst team. Then the next amount would go to the 2nd worst team and so on until all the penalized teams pick are accounted for.

### Further Penalites if Draft Picks Unavailable

If a team remains over the luxury tax for two season and has no draft picks, they will face the following penalties.

1. No future draft picks can be traded until they get under the cap
2. All future picks are last in the round until they get under the cap.
3. Unbalanced trades are blocked. This means that in all trades you must send more money than you would receive.

### Current Salary Cap Standings

Each team may be under or over the league's luxury tax cap. If the total amount of a team's salaries are over the luxury tax cap , this number will be negative (-). If it is under the cap, the number will be positive (+). Note: The cap status listed here is from the end of the previous season.

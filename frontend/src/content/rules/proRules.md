## In Season Free Agent Signing

In-Season Free Agent Signing is started by a team posting the player they wish to sign in the transactions-freeagent-signings channel. Then that player is available until the next sim or for 6 hours, whichever period is shorter, to give any other teams a chance of signing him. After the waiting period, Commissioner will use the website [True Random Number Generator](http://www.random.org/) to calculate the number. Three random numbers will be average together to get the free agent number of interest.

The following are the changes to sign the free agent depending on the number of interested teams.

1. If only one team is involved, then that team signs him.
2. If two teams are involved, then the first team has a 85% chance of signing him and the second team has only 15%. Example: team one has from (1-85) and team two has from (86-100).
3. If three teams are involved, then the break down is team one gets 80% (1-80), team two get 15% (81-95), and team three get 5% (96-100).
4. If four teams are involved, then the break down is team one gets 75% (1-75), team two gets 15% (76-90), team three gets 7% (91-97), and team four gets 3% (98-100).

**NOTE:** Only four teams can claim a free agent. After the fourth team has
claimed him, the claims are finalized. Only the first four teams will
have the chance of signing the player.

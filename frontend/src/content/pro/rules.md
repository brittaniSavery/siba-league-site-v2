## Multiplayer

The GMs in the league will need to export their files using the fax
machine on the office page (Export MP File). These should be imported
prior to each of the following stages:

- Owner/GM phone calls
- Each Day of Coach Hiring
- Pre-Draft Workouts
- Each Day of Free Agency
- Training Camp
- D-League Assignments
- Any Change to Depth Chart, Sub Matrix, D-League Assignments
- Player Instructions During the Season

These files need to be uploaded. All other stages of the season are
handled by the Commissioner directly, and GMs should contact him via
email or some other method to communicate their instructions.

## In Season Free Agent Signing

In-Season Free Agent Signing is started by a team posting the player they wish to sign in the transactions-freeagent-signings channel. Then that player is available until the next sim or for 6 hours, whichever period is shorter, to give any other teams a chance of signing him. After the waiting period, Commissioner will use the website [True Random Number Generator](http://www.random.org/) to calculate the number. Three random numbers will be average together to get the free agent number of interest.

The following are the changes to sign the free agent depending on the number of interested teams.

1. If only one team is involved, then that team signs him.
2. If two teams are involved, then the first team has a 85% chance of signing him and the second team has only 15%. Example: team one has from (1-85) and team two has from (86-100).
3. If three teams are involved, then the break down is team one gets 80% (1-80), team two get 15% (81-95), and team three get 5% (96-100).
4. If four teams are involved, then the break down is team one gets 75% (1-75), team two gets 15% (76-90), team three gets 7% (91-97), and team four gets 3% (98-100).

**NOTE:** Only four teams can claim a free agent. After the fourth team has
claimed him, the claims are finalized. Only the first four teams will
have the chance of signing the player.

## Definitions

Here are a list of term definitions that will help GMs as they manage their teams.

- **SALARY CAP vs LUXURY CAP**

  The salary cap acts as a “soft cap” meaning that it can be exceeded in
  certain situations (such as re-signing bird rights players or signing
  players to minimum contracts). The luxury cap is not so much a cap on
  anything but a threshold that once your salary crosses the team
  ownership gets penalized with paying extra taxes for doing so. This
  number is important because your ownership may allow you to spend over
  the salary cap but might want you to stay under this luxury cap number.
  Your amount under the luxury cap will also impact your ability to use
  the mid-level exception.

- **EXCEEDING THE SALARY CAP**

  As mentioned the salary cap is a “soft cap” and can be exceeded
  in some situations. You can always sign players to a minimum contract.
  If you have a restricted free agent who gets an offer you can exceed the
  cap to match that offer. You can also exceed the cap when using the
  low-level, mid-level or bird rights exceptions.

- **BIRD RIGHTS**

  Bird Rights are acquired by players when they finish the season
  on a team roster. If a player is released or changes teams via free
  agency his bird rights years are reset to zero but they do not reset if
  he is traded or resigns with his own team. Bird right years are
  important because they determine how much you can offer your player in
  free agency. This is an advantage for the team who has the player last
  because while all other teams need cap space or an exception to bid on
  the player the team holding his bird rights does not.

  Players with three or more bird years can receive any amount up to the
  league maximum contract for their number of years of experience in the
  league with 7.5% annual raises. Players with two bird years can be
  signed for up to 175% of the previous season’s contract amount assuming
  that does not exceed the league maximum for his experience level with
  7.5% annual raises. Players with just one bird year can be offered up to
  120% of their previous contract with 4.5% annual raises.

- **OTHER EXCEPTION**

  You may also have the mid-level exception and low-level exceptions
  available to you in free agency. Teams over the luxury cap amount or far
  under the salary cap will not get these exceptions so keep that in mind
  during your contract planning.

- **RESTRICTED FREE AGENTS**

  When a player finishes his full rookie contract (four years for first
  round picks, two years for second round picks) they have the ability to
  become restricted free agents. This means that you tender them a
  temporary contract and allow them to become a free agent. If they
  receive an offer in free agency they wish to accept you will get the
  chance to match that contract or lose the player with no compensation.
  If they do not find an offer they like they will have to sign with your
  team for one season for the temporary contract amount and then next
  season will become an unrestricted free agent. Keep this in mind when
  making an offer for another team’s RFA that if you’re not overpaying the
  team is probably likely to match the offer. Players do not become RFAs
  automatically. You have to go to your contracts page and make them a
  “qualifying offer” on or before the CONTRACTS action date in the game.

- **CAP HOLDS AND RENOUNCING RIGHTS**

  You may wonder why players who are now free agents are still
  counting against your salary cap. These are cap holds and any player who
  is a bird rights free agent has one that counts against your team -
  otherwise teams could use up all of their cap space and then try to
  resign their own bird rights free agents by going over the cap. If you
  want to have salary cap space to use then you will have to renounce the
  bird rights of your free agents. Do this on the CONTRACTS date in the
  game as well by going to your team contracts page and choosing the
  renounce option for players. This will free up the cap space but also
  take away the bird rights for the player.

- **EXTENSIONS**

  You can try to extend the contracts of your own players from your
  team contracts page as the season goes along but often times you will
  see that the player is asking for more money than you can offer in an
  extension. This is not a bug - it is what the player wants and often
  times it is more advantageous to the player to go to free agency even if
  he intends to resign with your team to be able to get the most money
  possible.

- **TWO-WAY CONTRACT**

  Two way contracts essentially allow you to have
  team control over two additional players who do not count against your
  15 man roster limit or your salary cap. When you sign a player to a two
  way contract he is placed on your development league affiliate on a two
  year contract. He remains there unable to be signed by another team
  until his contract runs out. You can call this player up at any time but
  doing so will remove the two way contract and replace it with a regular
  contract that does count against your salary.

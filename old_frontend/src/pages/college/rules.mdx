## General Information

The Simulation Internet College Basketball (SICBA) league is powered by Draft Day Sports: College Basketball **2021** version 9.7. We are skipping DDS:CB 2022 and will move to DDS:CB 2023 once it becomes available.

Simulations run three times per week, every Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday. The export file must be uploaded by **4:00 PM (Central Time)** on a sim day to ensure that it will included in the sim. After 4PM, there is no guarantee your changes will be included. To export, check out the pinned messages in the `#sicba-news` channel in Slack.

## Team Tiers and Rankings

Teams each have a tier ranking and a recruiting region. Tier 1 teams are the best of the best and the most well-known. Tier 2 teams have the broadest range of skill and recognition. And finally Tier 3 teams are usually from smaller schools and/or have mediocre records.

These rankings are re-evaluated every pre-season. The [pre-season rankings](/college/rankings) show the current rankings for the season. Below shows how the rankings determine the tier.

- Tier 1: 1–40
- Tier 2: 41–199
- Tier 3: 200–357

The recruiting region of a team is determined by the state where the school is located. There are five regions: Atlantic East, Midwest, Southeast, Great Plains, and West. If a school is based in California, their region would be West, for example. Refer to the map below to see which states belong to which region.

**NOTE:** Each person is allowed to coach up to three (3) teams, all of different tiers and different regions. None of your selected teams can share a tier or a recruiting region.

Here are examples of valid and invalid team choices based on this sample school list.
